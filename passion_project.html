	<h1 style="font-size:45px;font-family:Verdana;color:Brown;background-color:pink">My Passion Project</h1>
	<p>Today is my first day at WDI-General Assembly. I do not know much about projects as of now but I would love to build a clone of facebook and work it as my own separate project out of the WDI. I would love to work with my classmates. Building a website like facebook would help to create new things and it will also certainly help with the coding experience and finally get more out of this WDI Program.</p>
